# Working with menus

The primary means of navigating your site is the main menu, found at the top of every public facing page. Working with menus is
easy, and you have complete control over the items found in the menu, and what each item links to.

<div style="background: #ffcccb; padding: 1em; border-radius: 1em; text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">
	<b>Note</b>: In order to be able to manage menu items, your system administrator must have assigned you
	the necessary role. If you do not have the needed role, you will not have the option to modify the menu.

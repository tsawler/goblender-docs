## Adding Gallery Images

Manging the GoBlender gallery is a simple process. Provided you **have the necessary role**, you can simply navigate to the `/gallery` page. At the top of the page you will see a
button labelled **Add Gallery Image**. Click on it, and the **Gallery Item** dialog will appear.

Use this dialog to browse for a new image, give the item a name, and assign it to a gallery tag. You can also make items active or inactive.


## Editing Gallery Images

If you want to change a gallery image, just click on the **pencil icon** under the image. The **Gallery Item** modal will appear, and you can change whatever you wish.


## Deleting Gallery Images

To delete an image from the gallery, click on the **trash can icon** under the image, and click okay in the confirmation dialog.

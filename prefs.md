# System Preferences

GoBlender has a number of preferences that you can set for the entire site. These are managed under the Dashboard -> Preferences.

<div style="background: #ffcccb; padding: 1em; border-radius: 1em; text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">
	<b>Note</b>: In order to be able to manage preferences, your system administrator must have assigned you
	the necessary role. If you do not have the needed role, you will not have the option to modify the menu.
</div>


The Preferenceas menu on the left side of the dashboard has nine items:

1. General preferences - these are general settings for the entire site, and include mail server settings, fonts and colours, and many other options. 
1. Blog Preferences - settings for the blog and blog posts.
1. Refresh Templates - this forces GoBlender to reread page templates. You will rarely, if ever, use this, since it is used by developers.
1. Site Top Bar - edit the HTML for the top bar on the public site. 
1. Custom CSS - if you are comfortable with CSS, you can add or modify rules for the public site.
1. Custom JS - if you are comfortable with Javascript, you can add or modify scripts for the public site (i.e. Google Analytics, a Facebook pixel, etc.).
1. Site Footer - edit the HTML for the top bar on the public site. 
1. Alternate Database Connections - add, modify, or delete connections to alternate/remote databases.
1. Application Info - display basic information about the application.

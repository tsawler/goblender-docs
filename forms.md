# Creating Forms

Goblender has a fully-featured form builder integrated into the content management system. With this tool, you are able to create sophisticated forms
that are sent to any email address you wish, saved to the database, or both.

<div style="background: #ffcccb; padding: 1em; border-radius: 1em; text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">
	<b>Note</b>: In order to be able to manage forms, your system administrator must have assigned you
	the necessary role.
</div>


Building forms is a simple process: you simply drag and drop the form elements you want, where you want, and in the order you want. You can include
almost any form element you wish.

Naturally, all forms have validation and cross-site forgery request protection built in.
